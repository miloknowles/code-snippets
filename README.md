# Python Snippets

This repository contains code snippets (in Python3) that I've tended to reuse across projects. Feel free to copy-paste them into your own project, and check out the `tests` folder for usage. They've been factored to have as few code dependencies as possible.

## Setup

If you want to use the repository as-is, run `pipenv` install in the top directory.
